                                    <p>Partnered with the team to review the case from their perspective. We highlighted the symptoms of the challenges that were later used to <strong>design a contextual observation</strong> with users.
                                        I observed the usage, problem and general behavior with the system. Later set a benchmark for every stage of the user flow so we could <strong>measure the impact of the upcoming changes</strong>. </p>

                                        We used affinity mapping for pattern identification and sense-making and persona for empathy building.  </p>

                            <p>Users needed constant communication with their colleagues <strong>so they could synchronize their work</strong>. With the old system was common to have duplicated projects and they had to assign ownership verbally. After some idea generation workshops, 
                            we had chosen to build the messaging widget, one of the most used pieces of the new system.</p>

                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p>I engaged with the team as a solo researcher and designer to explore ways to optimize their tool and processes. This project involved a thorough understanding of the construction domain and user tasks.  </p>    
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p class="steps">01</p>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Understanding goals: product, user & data</h4>

                                    <p>Partnered with the team to review the case from their perspective. We highlighted the symptoms of the challenges that were later used to <strong>design a contextual observation</strong> with users.
                                        I observed the usage, problem and general behavior with the system. Later set a benchmark for every stage of the user flow so we could <strong>measure the impact of the upcoming changes</strong>. </p>

                                    <p>Conducted some explorative observation followed by contextual inquiries. Aimed at <strong>learning about their process, context, goals</strong> with a special focus on usability and workarounds.
                                        We used affinity mapping for pattern identification and sense-making and persona for empathy building.  </p>

                                    <p>Divided into small teams to built a journey mapping, we <strong>visualize all the touchpoints</strong> with the legacy system, <strong> highlighted user pain points</strong> and workaround.
                                        Data specialists <strong>unpacked to the team the knowledge</strong> and challenges to be solved. We captured notes with a mindset of solving problems (HMW) and <strong>prioritized around business impact and development efforts.</strong> </p>

                            <h7>For users, communication between colleagues was essential</h7>
                            <p>Users needed constant communication with their colleagues <strong>so they could synchronize their work</strong>. With the old system was common to have duplicated projects and they had to assign ownership verbally. After some idea generation workshops, 
                            we had chosen to build the messaging widget, one of the most used pieces of the new system.</p>

                            <p>To keep track of their workflow, users will surround themselves with paper. To help them we created the recall section:
                                a calendar view with projects sorted by time, a to-do list of jobs.</p>

                            <p>We re-architecture the data with subcategories for the extra division. That allowed them to capture more specific details providing more value to the customer.</p>
