                                    <p>Partnered with the team to review the case from their perspective. We highlighted the symptoms of the challenges that were later used to <strong>design a contextual observation</strong> with users.
                                        I observed the usage, problem and general behavior with the system. Later set a benchmark for every stage of the user flow so we could <strong>measure the impact of the upcoming changes</strong>. </p>

                                        We used affinity mapping for pattern identification and sense-making and persona for empathy building.  </p>

                            <p>Users needed constant communication with their colleagues <strong>so they could synchronize their work</strong>. With the old system was common to have duplicated projects and they had to assign ownership verbally. After some idea generation workshops, 
                            we had chosen to build the messaging widget, one of the most used pieces of the new system.</p>

                            <p>To keep track of their workflow, users will surround themselves with paper. To help them we created the recall section:

                        <h3>My Role</h3>
                        <p>The traditional process of estimating the value of a property <strong>was slow and purely transactional</strong>. Over the years,
                            the financial service channels had been <strong>designed in isolation</strong>, making the whole experience fragmented, confusing,
                            and often redundant. But dynamic changes across the property sector were occurring at a rapid rate, with a rising interest in alternative ways.
                        </p> 
                        <p>Driven by a wish to adopt a user needs approach and explore the opportunities within the service, I embarked with the team at CoreLogic & Pivotal Labs on a project to look at the process holistically. We fundamentally changed the way professionals involved in the phases of
                            the property valuation go about their jobs. We provided valuers with a <strong>set of digital tools to make smarter decisions and working efficiently</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>Spent days with valuers learning about their work on the field doing some contextual inquiry and interviewing them. Followed by data synthesis by visualization for easy sharing. Pairing to with valuers was essential for analysis and brainstorming solutions.
                                    Professional <strong>were trained differently and they had a diverse way to approach a job</strong>, finding the theme on the research data was challenging.</p>

                            <h7>Customers needed information about the status of their valuation.</h7>
                            <p>This generated lots of calls and job delays. Lenders would interrupt the valuers by calling them asking for information about the status.
                                The way the system was communicating the status was full of jargon. Through a card sorting exercise, <strong>we mapped the traditional system status to a new simple,</strong>
                                more user-friendly version. Implemented a design language where colors and shapes reflected the phases of the process and how many steps to reach completion.
                                That not only communicated what was happening at that moment but what will happen next.
                                Today anyone dealing with CoreLogic's valuation system can <strong>get the status of a valuation job at a glance</strong>. No need for calls. </p>

                            <h7>Valuers needed to capture notes constantly while inspecting.</h7>
                            <p>We introduced a new user interface with smarts built into to <strong>support data capture on the field</strong> and addons like photo management, geomapping tools and pre-set commentary that helped to reduce error while speeding up their work.
                            I setup the foundation of the design system featuring a minimalist design to support the complexity of their work. </p>

                            <h7>The industry needed a lightweight alternative to expensive reports.</h7>
                            <p>Dynamic changes across the industry were occurring at a rapid rate bringing interest in alternative service types from the baking, finance and government sectors.
                                We launched the ability to do commercial, residential or rural assessment remotely, <strong>incorporating geospatial capabilities and costumed methodology calculators</strong> depending on the job type.</p>

                            <p>We leveraged the government spatial data and aerial imagery to built the platform in a way that valuers could <strong>complete a broad range of assessments remotely and accurately</strong>.
                                Integrated with CoreLogic's Customer Data Store (CDS) which allows supplementing the users' knowledge with CoreLogic's and the Government open data set.</p>

                            <h7>Valuers couldn't access properties</h7>
                            <p>We assisted valuers effectively to conduct remote valuations. Through a simple step-by-step process, we introduced "The Resident" user flow, where they can upload images and documentation, time/date stamped with geo-coordinates as a basis to support valuers on desktop assessment, external inspection, or kerbside. Aligned to the Australian Property Institute guidelines, deployed with robust compliance services, solid data governance principles and technology standards.</p>
